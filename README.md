# Python for Beginners - Full Course [Programming Tutorial]

This repo contains code examples and my notes for the YouTube video "Python for Beginners - Full Course" from freeCodeCamp channel.

As I was already familiar with Python, this course wasn't necessary for me but gave me a good refresher on some functions and characteristics the Python uniquely has. I would say this course would be for someone who has some basic understanding of Python. 

Recommended for anyone who has interest in taking a beginner course in Python that covers many of the basics!
